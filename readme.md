## Q&A
**Where does the name "Starcel" come from?** 
- In software, the * character is used as a wildcard which could represent literally anything. One of the goals of Starcel is to allow you to run any conceivable command and represent any format of data.
- If you leave the axiomatically set area you will see your space and actions from a third person viewâ€”a single star suspended in the void.
- Starcel runs inside the cells of a spreadsheet.
- "cel" relates to our acceleration algorithm.
- One of the algorithms we designed allows the spawning of basis within a spatial dimension. These basis look like stars.

A quick note on this release:\
To submit a cell you will have to type ctrl+NUM*. This is because unreal engine did not allow capturing of ctrl+enter. It also has an engine bug where I would need to restart the entire project in order to fix the extra click needed to select and move objects. Currently, objects spawned will match your character rotation and scaling; this makes for spammy looking scenes, so we will eventually add autosnapping and alignment tools. Unfortunately, it will be a while before you see an update. Enjoy!

It does not offer full python support, for that please visit any of the following:
* https://github.com/recursion-computing/starcel-Panda3D (Platform Agnostic Networked Display Architecture 3D; I am currently developing on this branch)
* https://github.com/recursion-computing/starcel-ue4 (The plugin used here would've been great for UE5!) 
* https://github.com/recursion-computing/starcel-upbge (I think upbge is mature enough for a full implementation)
* https://github.com/recursion-computing/starcel-omniverse (Has some issues with 3D text, see the comments)
